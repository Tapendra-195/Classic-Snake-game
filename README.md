# Classic-Snake-game</br>
  mgame.cc = main file for snake game</br>
  snake.txt = text file containing high-score</br>
  snake.cc = snake class</br>

  To compile use g++ mgame.cc snake.cc </br>
  then it will create .exe file and you can run the file.</br>
  That is you will need to compile both mgame.cc and snake.cc at the same time (or compile and link them) to get the executable.</br>
